EC2-Classic & AWS Classic Link
EC2-Classic: Instances run in a single n/w shared with other customers in terms of networking.
Amazon VPC: Your instances run logically isolated to your AWS account.

If you want link b/w your VPC and classic instances
you need to create a classic link
for this you must associate a Security group.
and enable your instances to communicate privately from EC2 classic to your VPC using ipv4 private address.
