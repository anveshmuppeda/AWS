Internet gateway:
Internet gateway is act like a mediator b/w the internet and VPC.
It will allow the VPC to connect to the outside internet.
From here only all the traffic flowed. and each VPC have a associated internet GW.

Route Table:
From internet g/w and VPC the route table is the mediator.
From internet the traffic routed directly to route tables, route tables are associated to internet gateway if it is public.
In route table we specify the subnets,
if the route table is public then we linked the internet gateway to the route table then associated to respective public subnets.
If route table is private, then we don't link the internet gateway here, we just associate the respective private subnets.


NAT gateway:
NAT gateway is specific to AG, and we need to maintain individual NAT GW for individual AG's to overcome failover.
NAT Gateway directly server the traffic to the internet gateway.
